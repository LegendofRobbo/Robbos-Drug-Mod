chuck this in addons

you'll need drugsmod installed to see the models of some drugs, you can find it at:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696374067
if  you don't want to have drugsmod installed you can simply change their models to something else by looking in lua/entities and changing the ones you want

then just add them to darkrpmodification like so
